# Leaflet-Webmaps-with-Python-and-Folium

The program is made in python to create a web map, marking a specific area in the map. 
It uses markers to show the volcanoes present in the area.
The markers are given a specific color coding based on their elevation.
The map also has strong boundaries around it to show the shapes of the different countries.
There is a selection layer , which can be checked and unchecked to see the volcanoes or the entire map without any markings.
